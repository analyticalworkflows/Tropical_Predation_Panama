# Tropical_Predation_Panama
This repository is for the first chapter of my thesis, focusing on the project understanding the impact of predation and upwelling on recruitment in tropical systems, and comparing tropical systems in 1970 and 2024

Raw data from the field is found under the "photos" folder - this includes photos of recruitment tiles, site photos, and scans of datasheets. Data from photos and community surveys, past and present, is found in the "data" folder.
