![IMG_3454](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/919baff2-a717-41e6-8a7b-e0f94620ce05)

This repository is for the first chapter of my thesis, focusing on the project understanding the impact of predation and upwelling on recruitment in tropical systems, and comparing tropical systems in 1970 and 2024. This repository contains the data files, code, analysis, and results of the project. 

## Progress Updates
This project is in the early stages, so current work is focused on finishing photo analysis, entering data, and cleaning data. 

***

## Data
Raw data from the field is found under the ["photos" folder](https://github.com/sellkes/Tropical_Predation_Panama/tree/main/Photos) - this includes photos of recruitment tiles, site photos, and scans of datasheets. Data from photos and community surveys, past and present, is found in the ["data" folder](https://github.com/sellkes/Tropical_Predation_Panama/tree/main/Data). This folder also contains raw datafiles from [temperature loggers](https://github.com/sellkes/Tropical_Predation_Panama/tree/main/Data/Temperature_data).

## Code
All [code](https://github.com/sellkes/Tropical_Predation_Panama/tree/main/code) for this project is in R, and includes code for things like analyses, data visualization, etc...
