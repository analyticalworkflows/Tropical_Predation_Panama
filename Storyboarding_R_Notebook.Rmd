This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# This file will be used to storyboard the paper for this project. I plan to use this to display the main results and figures for my paper to share with my collaborators, as well as outline the other sections of the paper.
```


```{r}
#This is where I plan to display key figures, which I would use a source_rmd code to run the analyses and display the figures I want collaboraters to see. I assume I will do this by creating .rmd files that run only the figures I want, then running them here, but I'm not sure yet.

#Intro Outline - This is where I will outline the intro once I have the figures and results created
# - Reserach Questions
# Q1: What are the effects of predators on the recruitment success of invertebrates on Taboguilla Island? 
# Q2: Is the impact of predation on recruitment success in 2024 similar to the 1970s?
# Q3: What are the impacts of upwelling on the recruitment success of invertebrates on Taboguilla Island? 
# Q4: Is the composition of the intertidal community on Taboguilla Island similar in 2024 and the late 1970s/early 1980s? If not, what has changed?

#Methods Outline
# - Start with description of study sites (Taboguilla Island) and include a map (source_rmd for the map I create)
# - Describe how we got environmental variables
#   - Temperature (HOBOs, sattelite data)
# - Next, describe community suvey descriptions - first with 1970s, then with 2024
# - Describe predation exclusion experiments, first 1970s, then 2024
# - Describe statistical plan
#   - NMDS and accompanying analyses (monte carlo stuff, environmental/treatment variables, etc..) - check McCune book to make sure it's all good 
#   - Figure out other analyses to compare time (ask Julia)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
